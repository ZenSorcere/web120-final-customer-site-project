 <p class="important"><em>This page has been more challenging than expected, trying to combine the Isotope search/sort filtering along with the Gridder.io gallery option. as of 12/5, I'm thinking it will be best if I focus on just including the gridder functionality for Google-image-like product views, and possibly some dummy buttons for sorting, since the process of making those two compatible is very challenging.</em></p>

 <p>Product images with title and price shown here, ideally in a 4/3/2 column layout dependant on device.  Clicking an image will bring up a large image with specific product information, and a (non-functioning for now) Add to Cart button.</p>
